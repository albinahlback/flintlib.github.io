## Program

The workshop will focus on on coding sprints to develop FLINT and improve
FLINT’s integration in other software.
(Developers of other mathematical software with no direct link to FLINT are also
welcome!)

Depending on participant interest, we may arrange a small number of tutorials
and technical talks.
Feel free to reach out to the organizers with presentation proposals or
suggestions for topics you'd like to see covered.

Additional informal talks and public discussions will be scheduled as the need
arises.
