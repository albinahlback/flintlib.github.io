# 2023 FLINT development workshop

## When and where

October 9 - 13, 2023

## Program

The workshop will focus on on coding sprints to develop [FLINT](https://flintlib.org/) and improve FLINT's integration in other software.

Depending on the number of participants, we may arrange a small number of tutorials and technical talks (O(1) / day).

Here is a tentative list of topics for coding sprints (feel free to add more ideas):

* FLINT's integration in OSCAR

* Linear algebra in FLINT
* Generics in FLINT
* Streamlining FLINT
* Maintenance and documentation
