## Program

The workshop will focus on on coding sprints to develop [FLINT](https://flintlib.org/) and improve FLINT's integration in other software.
We start 9:30 on Monday morning in room 48-519, and finish Friday afternoon.

Depending on the number of participants, we may arrange a small number of tutorials and technical talks (O(1) / day).

Here is a tentative list of topics for coding sprints (feel free to add more ideas):

* FLINT's integration in OSCAR
* Wrappers in other programming languages
* Linear algebra in FLINT
* Generics in FLINT
* Streamlining FLINT
* Maintenance and documentation
