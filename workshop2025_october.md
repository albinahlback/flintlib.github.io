  ([location](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=48.71441&mlon=2.20540#map=18/48.71441/2.20540))

## Program

The workshop will focus on coding sprints to develop FLINT and improve FLINT's
integration in other software.  Developers of other mathematical software with
no direct link to FLINT are also very welcome.

Depending on participant interest, we may arrange a small number of tutorials
and technical talks.  Feel free to reach out to the organizers with
presentation proposals or suggestions for topics you'd like to see covered.

Additional informal talks and public discussions will be scheduled as the need
arises.
